Make sure you are currently in the `root` folder.

## Background

A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR)
is a contrastive learning method that aims to learn useful representations of
images through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognise
similarities between a pair of augmented data points derived from the same input
image. The idea is that the network may learn to extract useful, generalised
features that can be used in downstream tasks.

We use ResNet-18 as the CNN architecture.

## Train

```bash
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.train -c C -epochs EPOCHS -aug AUG [-samples SAMPLES] [-fin FIN] [-fout FOUT]
# Run for help/description
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.train -h
```

If training successful, the model can be found in `models/`.

`-c`
- Specifies MedMNIST2D dataset to be used: https://medmnist.com/
- Accepted arguments below
```py
pathmnist, chestmnist, dermamnist, octmnist, pneumoniamnist, retinamnist, 
breastmnist, bloodmnist, tissuemnist, organamnist, organcmnist, organsmnist
```

`epochs`
- Maximum number of epochs

`aug`
- Specifies which augmentation sequence to use. Accepted inputs: `natural`,
  `novel`, `simple`, `greyscale`. Use [Data preview](#data-preview) environment
  to see effect of augmentations.

`samples`
- Number of training samples
- Default: uses all training samples

`fin`
- Input pretrained model filename used as a starting point for further
  pretraining
- Default: newly initialised ResNet-18

`fout`
- Output model filename
- Default: `pretrain-[category]`

### Example

```bash
# Quick demo: takes 5 minutes to train
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.train -c breastmnist -epochs 3 -aug natural -samples 20 -fout simclr-demo
# Takes 1 day to train on GPU
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.train -c dermamnist -epochs 2000 -aug natural
# Perform further pretraining on a pretrained model
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.train -c breastmnist -epochs 2000 -aug natural -fin pretrain-dermamnist
```

If training successful for the demo, the model can be found as
`models/simclr-demo.ckpt`.

## Feature analysis

Perform feature analysis on learned representations using dimensionality
reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE. Visualisations are saved in the root
respository under `out/`.

You must have an existing pretrained model.

```bash
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.feature_analysis -c C -fin FIN -tsne
# Run for help/description
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.feature_analysis -h
```

`-c`
- Specifies MedMNIST2D dataset to be used: https://medmnist.com/
- Accepted arguments below
```py
pathmnist, chestmnist, dermamnist, octmnist, pneumoniamnist, retinamnist, 
breastmnist, bloodmnist, tissuemnist, organamnist, organcmnist, organsmnist
```

`fin`
- Input pretrained model filename. Data is passed through base encoder to output
  features. Components are learned on train features and reduced test features
  are visualised.

`tsne`
- If not included, perform PCA then t-SNE with default parameters, visualising
  the reduced test data points. If included, perform t-SNE with various
  perplexity values, visualising both reduced train and test data points.

### Example

```bash
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.feature_analysis -c breastmnist -fin simclr-demo
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.feature_analysis -c bloodmnist -fin pretrain-dermamnist -tsne
```

## Data preview

Visualise original and augmented images to compare the effect of data
augmentations.

### Example

```bash
$ python -m pretrain.simclr.data_preview -c pathmnist -aug novel
```

## TensorBoard

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir pretrain/simclr/models/tb_logs
```
